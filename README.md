# LigmabOS
An OS with a GUI

This OS was built with reference to the osdev wiki and some Udemy courses to code the GUI.

To-do:
- ext2 filesystem
- revise code for better mouse latency
- fix keyboard input
- timer functions
- redo certain areas with more intuitive code (for easier modification in future)
